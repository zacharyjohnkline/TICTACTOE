TIC TAC TOE

## How to Play

Players take turns clicking the square in which they wish to place their 'mark' (either an X or an O --- always starting with an X)

## How to Win
One of the players needs to place on the board three marks that are adjacent in a singular continuous line.

## How to Tie
If neither player manages to get three adjacent squares that comprise a singular line, then the match is a tie and no one wins.  Simply hit the reset button to start over.

## Roadmap of Future Improvments
I would most likely create gifs to utilize in conjunction with the onclick events for the animations.  For the score tracker, I'm not very certain with the way I have the code created.  I found it too difficult to communicate back to the parent App component from the onclick events I created for each of the square divs because I am still very new to React.  I know with vanilla javascript I could simply increment a global variable tied to a DOM element every time there was a winner, but I honestly couldn't figure out how to communicate the winner back up the chain of components and so I don't really know at this moment how I would do that.

# ENJOY!
