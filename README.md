## How to Play

Players take turns clicking the square in which they wish to place their 'mark' (either an X or an O --- always starting with an X)

## How to Win
One of the players needs to place on the board three marks that are adjacent in a singular continuous line.

## How to Tie
If neither player manages to get three adjacent squares that comprise a singular line, then the match is a tie and no one wins.  Simply hit the reset button to start over.
